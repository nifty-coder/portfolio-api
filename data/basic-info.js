    description: `Hi! Computer programming is my passion. I'm a person who always wants to enhance and develop my knowledge because I love to learn! I have Cerebral Palsy by birth but I don't let that hinder my ability to learn new skills. I am always determined to learn and achieve greater heights. I'm very open-minded. I always respect others. I always like to help others and prefer to share my knowledge. That's why I started my channel!
    \n My long-term goal is to become an entrepreneur of a technology company. I want to set up a software development company that will make a voice-based operating system and voice-based programming language that uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. All software that my company develops will be open source. I want to make my company the best disabled-friendly employer!`
